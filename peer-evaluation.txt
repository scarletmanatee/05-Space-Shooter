Peer's repository: scarletmanatee, not sure of actual name



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
How to use checkforcollisionwithlist properly. I never seem to implement it properly since it hits 
every tick, but he/she seemed to figure it out. 
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
I almost never use the mouse when I code games, so maybe I could give that a try. Also I saw d.damage when calculating
the damage, which reminded me that I am able to give different enemies different damage.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
Probably some more comments that explain code. I don't think I saw any comments from the user, only from the template.
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
Any of the user-created code that was not given in the template could use comments explaining it.
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
No.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes.
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
It looks like it is still from the initial commit, so it could describe it as a game
instead of introducing the assignment.
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
It was very clean and concise.
